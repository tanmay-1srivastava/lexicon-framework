  Rob: "Uh, so Tina, um... I've been thinking now that, uh, I’m almost outta this hospital, I really need to get, uh, away for a bit. Just somewhere... you know, uh, where I can forget about, uh, checkups and all that. Are you—would you be up for planning something together? Like, maybe, uh, are you thinking beach or, uh, some mountain place, or maybe just a city tour?"
}
08:01:24{
  Tina: "Rob, yes! I was, uh, hoping you'd ask. Honestly, after all you’ve been through, you deserve, like, the best holiday. Um, I guess, first question is, uh, do you have any budget you wanna stick to? Like, uh, should we go for somewhere fancy, or, I mean, are budget hotels or hostels cool for you?"
}
08:01:39{
  Rob: "Hmm, uh, I don't mind either way, really. I’d be happy just, uh, chilling by a pool with you. Or, you know, if you wanna do something wild like, uh, glamping or hiking, I could probably try that—well, as long as it’s not too, uh, intense, you know? Guess the weather matters too. Is there anywhere you’ve had in mind lately?"
}
08:01:58{
  Tina: "Well, I do love a good beach party. But, uh, I think a mountain retreat sounds amazing too. We could, like, look up the weather, right? Um, and, you know, make sure there’s no crazy storms or, uh, travel warnings around. Uh, health stuff too, especially with Covid rules still hanging around."
}
08:02:13{
  Rob: "Yes, definitely. I’ll need to, uh, double-check on my vaccine card and, uh, masks and that sort of thing. All the boring travel stuff… passport, visa… you know how it is. Do you think we’d need, uh, travel insurance for a short trip?"
}
08:02:27{
  Tina: "Yeah, I’d say for peace of mind, absolutely. Especially since you just got better. Oh, and don’t forget to, like, pack stuff like sunblock and a first aid kit. I always overpack, haha, but, uh, it’s better safe than sorry."
}
08:02:42{
  Rob: "Haha, I usually make a list so I don’t forget stuff. Umm, so, what about food? Should we look up, uh, vegetarian options or maybe try some local street food? I heard cooking classes can be fun."
}
08:02:55{
  Tina: "Ooh, yes! I would love to try cooking classes. Also, I’m all about street food when I travel. We can check out local restaurants too, uh, maybe make a few reservations if it’s busy where we go. You’re still not doing spicy, right?"
}
08:03:10{
  Rob: "Ha! No, uh, still not brave enough for that. But, you know, museum visits or, um, some art galleries could be nice too. I remember in school you always dragged me to those places. Uh, any new spots you wanna see?"
}
08:03:26{
  Tina: "So many! Architectural spots, amusement parks, even, uh, water sports—I’d love to try kayaking or zip lining. We could go on some guided tours if that’s easier for you. Do you wanna drive, or, you know, just chill and let others lead?"
}
08:03:41{
  Rob: "Maybe, uh, we can plan for some guided tours. I feel better about that, especially after being indoors so long. I’m, uh, not up for any crazy solo treks just yet. But, uh, shopping’s always fun too—local markets or malls?"
}
08:03:57{
  Tina: "Yes! That’s my favourite part, honestly. Holidays equals shopping for me, haha. We should set a budget though—don’t let me go overboard. We can check for sales, you know, seasonal discounts, and stuff."
}
08:04:11{
  Rob: "Agreed. Okay, so—would you rather it’s just us, or should we ask the old gang from school? Like, Nisha, Tyler, and Jack? Or should we keep it small?"
}
08:04:25{
  Tina: "Hmm, I think it depends where we go. If it’s a weekend trip, a small group feels easier. But, uh, we can always poll everyone, right? Like, see who’s free and then make the final plan. More people, more fun, but also—more chaos?"
}
08:04:41{
  Rob: "Yeah, too many cooks, haha. So—travel-wise, you’d prefer flying or a road trip? I could try renting a car if it’s nearby, but, uhh, flights might need early booking?"
}
08:04:56{
  Tina: "If you’re good with driving, I’d love a road trip. Otherwise, I can check for flights and see if there’s, you know, last-minute deals. We should use one of those travel apps to keep everything organized."
}
08:05:09{
  Rob: "Good idea. Those help with maps, right? And language stuff? I always get nervous if there’s any translation needed, especially with, you know, etiquette stuff abroad."
}
08:05:21{
  Tina: "Oh, totally! I’ll download a few. And, uh, don’t forget memory making—are you bringing your camera this time? I always love your photos. Ooh, should we do a travel vlog for fun?"
}
08:05:34{
  Rob: "Haha, uh, I could try! Maybe start with just photos though. Social media sharing is fine, but I’ll probably leave the vlogging to you. Uh, we have to find good places for scenic views and, maybe, botanical gardens..."
}
08:05:50{
  Tina: "You know me too well. I’m also thinking—let’s pencil in some relaxation. Like, spa treatments, maybe yoga. If there’s a cool festival in town, that’d be fun too. And, uh, I want cake at a café. Like, real LA-style."
}
08:06:05{
  Rob: "Deal. If anything goes off plan, we’ll just, uh, adjust. I’ll pack all essentials—power banks, travel pillows, you name it. Emergency cash, just in case."
}
08:06:18{
  Tina: "Perfect. Okay, Rob, sounds like we both want this trip to be chill but full of memories. Let’s make a list and check everyone’s schedules tomorrow, yeah?"
}
08:06:32{
  Rob: "Yeah, let’s do that. This is gonna be the best holiday. Thanks, Tina."
