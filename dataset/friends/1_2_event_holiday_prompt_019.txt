    Rob: "Hey Tina, you finally got a break, huh? Man, these shifts get longer every day. So uh, have you actually thought about where you wanna go for our holiday? I keep bouncing between the idea of just chilling at the beach, like a full-on resort thing, or heading to the mountains for some kinda retreat. What do you think?"
  }
  17:02:13{
    Tina: "Oh, tell me about it. My feet are killing me, Rob. Honestly, both sound great, but my budget is, um, pretty tight this year. I’ve been looking up some budget hotels and even checked out a few Airbnb rentals. If we go as a group, we could probably split the bills and get some holiday discounts, you know?"
  }
  17:02:25{
    Rob: "Yeah, good point. Sharing expenses definitely helps, especially with everything getting pricier. Have you looked at flight tickets yet or like, do you think a road trip would be better? If it’s close enough, booking a self-drive rental could save us a lot. Or we could try public transport, do a full city tour with, I dunno, guided visits to all the local museums and little bakeries."
  }
  17:02:41{
    Tina: "Actually, I kinda love the idea of a road trip. More flexibility, right? *pause* Oh! Packing will be a bit of a deal though. Definitely travel snacks, water bottles... uhh, don’t let me forget sunscreen and sunglasses. If we're doing beaches, we need swimsuits. And in case it rains, I’ll bring my boots and jacket. Also, let’s not skip on travel insurance, especially with Covid rules still around. Have you checked about vaccinations?"
  }
  17:02:55{
    Rob: "Vaccinations, right. Um, I think I’m up to date, but I’ll double check just in case. Haven’t renewed my passport yet though. I heard some borders are still doing quarantine checks, so we better sort our documents and contacts. I’ll put together a first aid kit too, always good to have, especially with my luck."
  }
  17:03:07{
    Tina: "Haha, yeah, better safe than sorry with you, Rob. I’ll handle the currency exchange. I know my bank has a good deal. Oh, we should map out nearby ATMs for emergencies. Uh, hey, do we need pet-friendly hotels this time? Are you planning to bring Max again?"
  }
  17:03:18{
    Rob: "Of course, Max is part of the family now. He’s coming. I’ll check pet-friendly options. *pause* Gotta remember his treats and, uh, a travel water bowl or something. Hey, maybe look up local festival dates too? Would be fun to catch a concert or something, and definitely street food. I’m pretty excited about restaurant hopping this trip."
  }
  17:03:32{
    Tina: "Totally! Food tours, cooking classes, maybe a wine tasting if we end up near a brewery. I’m all in for cultural stuff. We should list the must-see spots, check reviews, create a shared doc or something. And let’s vote on the plans with everyone later. Plan flexibility is key. Never know when we get delayed or lose our way."
  }
  17:03:44{
    Rob: "So true. Last time, Jack managed to miss his bus, so yeah, keeping the plan flexible is smart. I'll download a translation app, just in case we run into language issues. I’ll also read up on local etiquette and safety tips as a backup."
  }
  17:03:54{
    Tina: "Good call. I want to go shopping, hit some outlet stores, artisan markets. Planning to snag a few souvenirs. Shopping budget’s kinda strict but I’m up for bargaining! We can take lots of pics, maybe start a travel vlog and share the trip with everyone from work."
  }
  17:04:04{
    Rob: "You know, that’d be cool. Vlogging, sharing the memories, maybe reliving some childhood spots too. I wouldn’t mind some thrill—kayaking, zip lining... you said paragliding before, right? We could look into that if the weather’s decent. Still, need some downtime too. A spa day or yoga class at the wellness place sounds like a dream right now."
  }
  17:04:16{
    Tina: "Yes! Wellness retreat for the win. Don’t forget Wi-Fi and SIM cards, though. Data plans are a must. I’ll ask about early check-in and late check-out times. If we mess up the hotel booking, at least glamping or camping gives us backup options."
  }
  17:04:27{
    Rob: "Right, backup plans never hurt. Amusement parks, guided tours, shopping malls… Think we’re gonna need to really plan the itinerary this time. Maybe aim for early bookings and snag those last-minute holiday deals. It could turn into one of those epic extended holidays if we do it right."
  }
  17:04:37{
    Tina: "Exactly! Let’s keep group decisions easy, and make sure everyone’s dietary restrictions are sorted. I’ll mark the vegetarian places so I don’t end up surviving on fries again. This is shaping up to be our best hospital staff getaway yet, Rob!"
  }
  17:04:46{
    Rob: "No kidding, Tina. Let’s finish up these plans tonight and make some real memories outside these hospital walls. I’m so ready for this!"
