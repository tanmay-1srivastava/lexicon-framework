PROMPT:
----------------------------------------
We aim to emulate realistic human conversations to support the development of AI agent–based applications.
In these scenarios, there is a recorder that records user’s conversations passively, observing the context and flow. 
To train these kind of AI agents, we need realistic human conversations in different scenarios. To make the AI agent 
more diverge, we want the users to converse in a realistic manner based on the context, place, and the relationship with the other person/audience.
Create conversations among the users using the following principles
1. The users speak based on the memory and the event.
2. The conversation lasts for 5-7 minutes.
3. The dialogues should be in a manner as a Automatic speech recognition system would transcribe the speaker's audio.
4. There should be proper pauses, utterance which resemble normal humans.
5. The output should be-
  {Timestamp{
    Speaker 1:"   ",}
    Timestamp{
      Speaker 2:"
      }
  }, where Speaker 1 and Speaker 2 are the people involved in the conversaion. Replace Speaker 1 and 2 with their respective names.
6. The dialogue only contains verbal statements made by speakers, no visual or non-verbal cues.
7. The category of the conversation is given in the events.
8. For a natural conversation flow, you can modulate references to time, location, and context by using deictic words such as here/there, now/then, or today/yesterday.
9. The conversation should be focussed between the speakers. They should not talk or shift their focus to other individual.

GPT RESPONSE:

{
09:02:15{
  Mathew: "Uh, morning, Dr. Robin. Thanks for seeing me. I’ve, um, got this pain in my lower left abdomen since last night. It’s kinda dull but sometimes it’s sharp, especially when I move. It woke me up a couple times."
}
09:02:23{
  Dr. Robin: "Okay, Mathew, let’s walk through this. Can you point to exactly where the pain is? And, ah, can you tell me if anything makes it better or worse, like eating, walking, or lying down?"
}
09:02:31{
  Mathew: "It’s, yeah, kind of just below my belly button but to the left. Moving seems to make it worse. Eating doesn't really seem to change anything. It's just, uh, there all the time. I tried lying down but it didn’t go away."
}
09:02:41{
  Dr. Robin: "Alright. And is there any nausea or have you, um, vomited at all? Any changes in your bowel movements or, hmm, any fever? I just want to get the full picture."
}
09:02:49{
  Mathew: "No vomiting. I did feel a little nauseous this morning, but nothing major. I haven't noticed any fever. The bathroom situation’s the same—no diarrhea or constipation."
}
09:02:59{
  Dr. Robin: "Good to know. Any blood in your stool or urine? I know that’s a little personal, but it helps."
}
09:03:03{
  Mathew: "Nah, no blood, everything looks normal there. I just, uh, feel a bit more fatigued than usual. Could be from the pain I guess."
}
09:03:09{
  Dr. Robin: "Hmm, understood. I see from your history here you’ve got migraines, vitamin D deficiency, fatty liver, dyspepsia, mild blood pressure. And you do night shifts, sometimes smoke and drink — is that right?"
}
09:03:19{
  Mathew: "Yeah, that’s right. I had a fast food meal two nights ago, but haven’t had anything like shrimp or stuff I’m allergic to."
}
09:03:27{
  Dr. Robin: "Okay, that helps. And you haven’t had any chills or sweats? Any recent travel? Any contact with anyone sick?"
}
09:03:33{
  Mathew: "No travel. I work nights at the IT firm, but haven’t heard of anyone around me being sick. No sweats or chills."
}
09:03:39{
  Dr. Robin: "Alright. I’m going to check your vital signs now — blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate. Just give me a minute. Okay, Mathew, your vitals look stable, BP is a little elevated compared to last time. No fever. I'm going to press gently on your abdomen now, let me know if it gets too uncomfortable."
}
09:04:06{
  Mathew: "Okay—uh—yeah, that spot’s tender, more than the rest."
}
09:04:10{
  Dr. Robin: "Noted. Thanks for telling me. Based on what you’re describing, I want to run a few tests here today: basic blood tests, urine analysis, maybe an ultrasound or a scan if needed. Just to check for things like infection, kidney stones, or issues with your intestines."
}
09:04:25{
  Mathew: "Sure, that sounds good. Will I need to stay here for long? I’ve got my next shift in two days."
}
09:04:30{
  Dr. Robin: "Let’s see what we find first. If it’s something simple, maybe not. If the tests show anything serious, we might need to keep you for observation. I’ll explain everything once the results are back. Um, I’ll also make sure we avoid shrimp in meals, and any medications you’re allergic to."
}
09:04:45{
  Mathew: "Thanks, doc. I just, uh, I get worried because my dad had some stomach issues last year. Don’t want to end up like him."
}
09:04:52{
  Dr. Robin: "It’s natural to be anxious, Mathew. I’ll keep you informed every step. Do you have someone at home if we need to contact family, just in case?"
}
09:04:59{
  Mathew: "Yeah, my brother’s in town. I can give his number if needed."
}
09:05:03{
  Dr. Robin: "Great, please do. Also, I’ll send someone in for the blood draw and urine sample. You might need to wait here a bit. Let me know if your pain gets worse or if you feel lightheaded."
}
09:05:16{
  Mathew: "Okay. Is there anything I should avoid eating or drinking for now?"
}
09:05:19{
  Dr. Robin: "Just keep it light—water, maybe some toast. Avoid alcohol, spicy stuff, and fast food until we know more."
}
09:05:27{
  Mathew: "Will do. Uh, is there any chance this is related to the fatty liver thing?"
}
09:05:31{
  Dr. Robin: "Possibly, but it’s not classic for fatty liver. We’ll check your liver function in the tests, just in case. I’ll keep you posted."
}
09:05:39{
  Mathew: "Thanks, Dr. Robin. Appreciate it."
}
09:05:42{
  Dr. Robin: "You’re welcome, Mathew. Just hang tight. I’ll check back after the results come through."
}
