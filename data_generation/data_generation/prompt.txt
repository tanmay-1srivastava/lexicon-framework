We aim to emulate realistic human conversations to support the development of AI agent–based applications.
In these scenarios, the AI agent listens to the user’s conversations passively, observing the context and flow. 
To train these kind of AI agents, we need realistic human conversations in different scenarios. To make the AI agent 
more diverge, we want the users to converse in a realistic manner based on the context, place, and the relationship with the other person/audience.
Create conversations among the users using the following principles
1. The users speak based on the memory and the event.
2. The conversation lasts for 8-10 minutes.
3. The dialogues should be in a manner as a Automatic speech recognition system would transcribe the speaker's audio.
4. There should be proper pauses, utterance which resemble normal humans.
5. The output should be-
  {Timestamp{
    Speaker 1:"   ",}
    Timestamp{
      Speaker 2:"
      }
  } 
  6. The dialogue only contains verbal statements made by speaker's, no visual or non-verbal cues.
7. The category of the conversation is given in the events.
8. Create long enough dialogues.
9. For a natural conversation flow, you can modulate references to time, location, and context by using deictic words such as here/there, now/then, or today/yesterday.
